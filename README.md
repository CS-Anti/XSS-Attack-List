# XSS-Attack-List
For ethical purposes only you know the drill. If you blame me for your shitty mistakes I will personally find you and unleash all the ethicalness on you ever. (But seriously. Dont be a stupid fucker, yk.)

Also all of these fucking work. If a website has XSS protection then or " == $0" then it will be immune to the attack tho. I also have alot more of these. 11,222 to be exact so just hmu.
